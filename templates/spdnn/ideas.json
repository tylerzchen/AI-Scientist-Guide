Modify the forward pass to incorporate this activation, ensuring compatibility with the current setup. Design experiments comparing SPDNN performance using Gumbel-Softmax with Bernoulli and Poisson activations, focusing on metrics like accuracy, convergence rate, and training time. Analyze the potential benefits for broader applications in stochastic environments and optical processing.",
