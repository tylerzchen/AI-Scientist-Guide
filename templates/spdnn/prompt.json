    "task_description": "You are given the following experiment.py file to work with, that trains a Single-Photon-Detection Neural Network (SPDNN). In essence, SPDNNs are uniquely designed to detect only a few photons with each dot product or neuron activation during inference. The models trained here can be integrated on various Optical Neural Network (ONN) platforms equipped with single-photon detectors (SPDs). In order to include the stochastic single-photon detection process during training, the program employs physics-aware stochastic training to incorporate the actual stochastic physical process forward pass, while eliminate the stochasicity in the backward pass. Interesting ideas would involve benchmarking the SPDNNs on different tasks, and also trying out new reparametrization or activation functions (e.g. using a Gumbel-Softmax reparam)."
